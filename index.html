    <h1>Essay on why to boycott israeli Products:</h1>
    <p>
    This is a <i><b>tough</b></i> topic. <b>People</b> boycott <sub>(refuse to buy)</sub> things to <i>protest</i> something <br> they don't like.
    <p> 
        <q>Here<sup>'</sup>s why they might boycott:</q>

       <br> <b><em>Land</em></b>: They believe <i><b>Israel</b></i> occupies land that belongs to <strong>Palestinians</strong>. <cite>This can make it hard</cite> for <strong> Palestinians</strong> to live there.
       <br> <b><em>Rights</em></b>: They worry <strong>Palestinians</strong> don't have the same rights as Israelis.
        <br>They hope a <ins>boycott</ins> will pressure Israel to change its ways.
    </p>
    <hr>Here are some things to consider:
    
    <br><b>Does it Work?:</b> It's not clear if boycotts hurt <b>Israel's</b> economy much. They might hurt some companies, but some <b>Israelis</b> might disagree with the government too.
    <br><b>Hurting People:</b> Boycotts can hurt regular <b>Israelis</b> who work for those companies.
    <br><b>Finding Alternatives:</b> 
    <br>1. <dfn>Check the Label:</dfn> Look for the <q>Made In</q> label on the <acronym title="product">PROD</acronym> itself. This will tell you the country of origin.
    <br>2. <dfn>Online Research:</dfn> If the label isn't clear, search online for the product and see if you can find information about where it's made.  Many companies list this information on their websites.
    <br>3. <dfn>Search by Country:</dfn> Some online retailers allow you to filter your search by country of origin. This can be helpful for finding products made in specific places.
    <br>4. <dfn>Look for Alternatives:</dfn> Many times there are similar products made in other countries.

    <p><b>Israel</b> has killed over 21x10<sup>3</sup> Palestinians since October 7, 2023. This includes a huge number of children and women. Most of the people killed in this war are civilians, including journalists. Israel blames Hamas for its recent genocide in the Gaza Strip. However, many, including <acronym title="United Nation">UN</acronym> Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, hold that the Hamas attacks did not happen in isolation, as they were the result of decades of oppression and occupation.</p>
    <p><b>The BDS Movement Against Israel:</b>
        <br>Israel’s technological advancement, its support by the United States and some other European nations, disharmony among the Muslim states, and its weak military strength have coerced the pro-Palestinian people to look for other means to stop Israel’s atrocities. Hence, the call for a boycott of pro-Israel and Israeli products has become an effective way to protest against Israel’s massacre in Palestinian land. For this purpose, the Palestinian people have developed the <abbr title="Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction movement">BDS</abbr> .</p>
